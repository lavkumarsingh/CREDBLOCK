<h1>Blockchain POC</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>According to [1], academic certificates are highly esteemed as
    they serve as an indicator of the human capital of their bearers.
    Human capital refers to the skills, competencies, knowledge and
    aptitudes achieved through education [2]. Academic
    qualifications are particularly important in employment
    situations as they serve as a guarantee of not just the knowledge,
    expertise and skills of the holders but also of their abilities,
    reliability and dedication [3]. From the perspective of the
    bearers, [4] found a positive correlation between educational
    attainment levels and better employment prospects and
    economic security. [5] pointed out that academic qualifications
    are deemed to be genuine when they are conferred by a
    university that is legally authorized to award such certificates.
    Because they are so valuable, people often lie about their
    academic qualifications by producing fake certificates. [6]
    mentioned that in the United States there are currently 2 million
    fake degree certificates in circulation and 300 unauthorized
    universities operating. [7] indicated that the United Sates has the
    highest number of fake institutions in the world followed by the
    United Kingdom which has about 270 fake institutes. Healy
    (2015) found that up to 35% of candidates in Australia falsified
    their academic credentials for the sake of employment. [8]
    observed that most candidates lie at least about some part of
    their educational credentials and experience. [9] mentioned that
    academic certificate fraud costs employers about $ 600 billion
    every year.
    There are five (5) different sources of fake academic certificates.
    These include ‘Degree Mills’ where bogus qualifications are
    generated and sold to clients[10], ‘Fabricated Documents’ that
    represent a fictitious degree or institute, ‘Modified Documents’
    that are alterations in legitimate documents such as changes in
    enrollment / graduation dates, grades, course content, date of
    birth, specialization etc, ‘In-House Produced’ which are fake documents fabricated by the employees of legitimate institutions
    and printed on authentic paper and bearing the seals, stamps and
    signatures of the institution and ‘Translations’ or documents
    inaccurately translated to match requirements in a receiving
    country. [7] also indicated academic certificates issued by
    institutions that are not registered / unaccredited / lack
    government authority to grant such credentials / make
    unsubstantiated claims about recognition and accreditations are
    fake. The implication arising from the above findings is that the
    problem of fake certifications has assumed serious and alarming
    proportions and needs to be urgently tackled. Blockchain
    technology is recently introduced to improve the document
    verification process and combats the document fraud and mise
    use. Blockchain technology simply can be defined as a distributed
    database, that chronologically stores a chain of data packed into
    sealed blocks [11]. However, the scope of this research is to
    determine a framework for implementing security requirements
    in educational certificate verification in the blockchain. The
    framework is intended to avoid the problem of fake certificates
    or fraud in educational certificates.

    <h2>BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY: FEATURES AND
    CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
    <p>
    Blockchain technology is not only a single technique, it is a
    combination of many techniques such as cryptography,
    mathematics, algorithms and distributed consensus algorithms
    [12], [13], [14]. A blockchain is composed of six key elements
    [15] as follows:</p>
    <h2>Decentralized.</h2>
    <p> Blockchain doesn’t have to rely on a single
    centralized node any more like a master node, each node can
    record, store and update the ledger, and together they form the
    blockchain.</p>

    <h2>Transparent.</h2> <p>The block’s data recorded by each node and
    distributed among other connected nodes is visible to each node
    which creates transparency among connected nodes.</p>
    <h2>Anonymous.</h2>
    <p>In order to make the transactions anonymous, data
    is hashed before sharing by using a secure algorithm.</p>
    <h2>Consensus Base.</h2>
    <p>Since node are publicly connected on
    blockchain and changes can only happen when majority of nodes
    accept the change, all nodes are eligible to transfer and update
    data safely providing a consensus base to the system.</p>
    <h2>Immutable.</h2>
    <p> All records are permanently kept which cannot be
    altered unless someone can take control of more than 51% nodes
    simultaneously.</p>
    <h2>Open Source.<h2>
    <p>Most Blockchain systems are open to everyone,
    allowing participants to modify the code and technology in ways
    that best suits their needs. However this does not mean that
    anyone can modify a running blockchain solution. Making any
    modification to a running solution means all connected nodes are
    publicly accepting the change.</p>
    <h2>Blockchain Structure</h2>
    <p>Each block in the blockchain contains five elements which are: 1)
    the main data; 2) the hash of the pervious block; 3) the hash of
    the current block; 4) the timestamp and 5) other information
    [15]</p>
    <h2>Main Data.</h2>
    <p>The data depends on the type of transaction; it is
    generally a transfer between nodes A and B however it can be of
    any type like money transfer or record transfer.</p>
    <h2>Hash of the Previous Block.</h2>
    <p>When a transaction is executed, its
    hash is generated and broadcasted to the network. There are
    several hashing algorithms in use but the most dominant is the
    Merkle Tree. This algorithm allows easy hash and easy de-hash
    options which is why Merkle Trees is a common choice.</p>
    <h2>Hash of the Current Block.</h2>
    <p>The final hash value is recorded in
    block header (hash of current block), while the content itself is
    stored in the body of the block. Blocks are generally bound to a
    size hence allowing a limited number of transactions per block.</p>
    <h2>Timestamp.</h2>
    <p>The time the block was generated.</p>
