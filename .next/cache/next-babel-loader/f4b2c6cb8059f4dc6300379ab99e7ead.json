Human capital refers to the skills, competencies, knowledge and aptitudes achieved through education [2]. Academic qualifications are particularly important in employment situations as they serve as a guarantee of not just the knowledge, expertise and skills of the holders but also of their abilities, reliability and dedication [3]. From the perspective of the bearers, [4] found a positive correlation between educational attainment levels and better employment prospects and economic security. [5] pointed out that academic qualifications are deemed to be genuine when they are conferred by a university that is legally authorized to award such certificates. Because they are so valuable, people often lie about their academic qualifications by producing fake certificates. [6] mentioned that in the United States there are currently 2 million fake degree certificates in circulation and 300 unauthorized universities operating. [7] indicated that the United Sates has the highest number of fake institutions in the world followed by the United Kingdom which has about 270 fake institutes. Healy (2015) found that up to 35% of candidates in Australia falsified their academic credentials for the sake of employment. [8] observed that most candidates lie at least about some part of their educational credentials and experience. [9] mentioned that academic certificate fraud costs employers about $ 600 billion every year. There are five (5) different sources of fake academic certificates. These include \\u2018Degree Mills\\u2019 where bogus qualifications are generated and sold to clients[10], \\u2018Fabricated Documents\\u2019 that represent a fictitious degree or institute, \\u2018Modified Documents\\u2019 that are alterations in legitimate documents such as changes in enrollment / graduation dates, grades, course content, date of birth, specialization etc, \\u2018In-House Produced\\u2019 which are fake documents fabricated by the employees of legitimate institutions and printed on authentic paper and bearing the seals, stamps and signatures of the institution and \\u2018Translations\\u2019 or documents inaccurately translated to match requirements in a receiving country. [7] also indicated academic certificates issued by institutions that are not registered / unaccredited / lack government authority to grant such credentials / make unsubstantiated claims about recognition and accreditations are fake. The implication arising from the above findings is that the problem of fake certifications has assumed serious and alarming proportions and needs to be urgently tackled. Blockchain technology is recently introduced to improve the document verification process and combats the document fraud and mise use. Blockchain technology simply can be defined as a distributed database, that chronologically stores a chain of data packed into sealed blocks [11]. However, the scope of this research is to determine a framework for implementing security requirements in educational certificate verification in the blockchain. The framework is intended to avoid the problem of fake certificates or fraud in educational certificates.\"), __jsx(\"h2\", {\n        className: \"jsx-3994394445\"\n      }, \"BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY: FEATURES AND CHARACTERISTICS\"), __jsx(\"p\", {\n        className: \"jsx-3994394445\"\n      }, \"Blockchain technology is not only a single technique, it is a combination of many techniques such as cryptography, mathematics, algorithms and distributed consensus algorithms [12], [13], [14].
